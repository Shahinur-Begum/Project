Authentication and Authorization
Our website implements a secure authentication and authorization system based on JWT (JSON Web Token). The userâ€™s role is embedded within the token, allowing role-based access control across the platform.

API Access: Access to APIs requires a valid JWT token to ensure security and proper authorization.

Vendor Role: Vendors have the ability to add, edit, and delete items. They also have access to a dedicated dashboard for managing their inventory and orders.

Guest Users: Guests can browse the list of vendors and view menus without authentication. However, any attempt to place an order will redirect guests to the login page to ensure account-based transactions.

Student Role: Students are required to register using a specific email format to validate their identity. Authenticated students can add preferred items to their cart and proceed with purchases seamlessly.

This role-based token system ensures a smooth and secure user experience tailored to different types of users while maintaining strict access control.
